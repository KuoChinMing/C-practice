# C-practice
## Learning C Practice

This repository contains my practice exercises for learning the C programming language. The goal is to improve my understanding and proficiency in C by working on various coding challenges and projects.

### Categories

#### Count Node Children
In this category, I focus on problems related to counting the number of children nodes in a tree data structure. These exercises help in understanding tree traversal techniques, recursive algorithms, and transforming abstract thinking into realistic code.

#### Binary Search Tree
This category includes exercises on implementing and manipulating binary search trees (BST). The tasks involve creating BSTs, inserting and deleting nodes, and performing search operations. These exercises are aimed at enhancing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms in C.
